   <p>
	The biryani stuffed inside the thin, golden-yellow omelette is also not your regular biryani, 
	it is brimming with the goodness of juicy mutton keema and spicy prawns. The omelette is made 
	in a heavy kadhai and seasoned with red chilli powder.<br> Once cooked, it is carefully scraped 
	out and placed on a plate, the biryani is placed right in the centre and the edges are folded 
	and the entire omelette is used to nicely wrap the biryani.<br> This ‘wrap’ is then served hot 
	with a spicy curry or salan and raita.
