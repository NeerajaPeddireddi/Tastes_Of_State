	The cashew seed is commonly considered a snack nut (cashew nut) eaten on its own, 
	used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter.<br> Like the tree, 
	the nut is often simply called a cashew.<br> Cashew allergies are triggered by the 
	proteins found in tree nuts, and cooking often does not remove or change these proteins.
